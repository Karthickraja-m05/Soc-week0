# 🧑‍💻 Karthickraja’s RISC-V SoC Tapeout Odyssey 🚀

---

> **Hey there, Silicon Trailblazer!**
>
> Welcome to my personal logbook for the VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program—a collective movement powering India's semiconductor momentum! With 3500+ passionate minds, we’re weaving the future of silicon, one week at a time.
>
> _“I’m architecting a System-on-Chip (SoC), from RTL to GDSII, using open-source EDA tools. This isn’t just coursework—it’s a national-scale, hands-on effort to realize real chips and fuel India’s tech aspirations.”_
>
> Follow my journey, milestones, and learnings as I build, reflect, and celebrate progress.

## 🖥️ SoC Design Workflow

| Step              | What’s Happening?                                                   |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **RTL Design**    | Logic creation in Verilog/VHDL                                      |
| **Synthesis**     | RTL → Gate-level netlist (Yosys, OpenLane)                          |
| **Physical Design**| Layout, placement, routing, floorplanning (Magic, KLayout)         |
| **Tapeout Prep**  | DRC/LVS checks, GDSII generation, fabrication handoff               |
